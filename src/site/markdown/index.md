Introduction
============

The Wire Maven Plugin wraps the [Wire protobuf compiler](https://square.github.io/wire/).

The current plugin only supports Java code generation.

This is a (resurrected) [fork](https://github.com/square/wire/tree/3.0.2/wire-maven-plugin) of the original plugin by the Wire project, which unfortunately got [dropped](https://github.com/square/wire/pull/1326).


See [usage](./usage.html) for a quick start or [integration test examples](https://github.com/marcelmay/wire-maven-plugin/tree/master/src/it).
